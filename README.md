# Large Scale Data Structures (LSDS) Course

## Course Overview

This repository contains assignments and materials for the graduate-level course on C/C++ programming with a focus on designing, implementing, and testing data structures for efficient "Big Data" storage and access in computer science and genomic applications.

### Course Objectives

1. Design, implement, and test custom classes and functions in an object-oriented C++ setting
2. Design and implement custom data structures
3. Understand memory management, access, and search time properties of covered data structures
4. Develop and implement test cases to quantify performance characteristics of data structures
5. Understand basic concepts in random number generation, probability mass functions, and computational simulations

## Repository Contents

This repository includes implementations and assignments related to the following data structures and algorithms:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Sorting Algorithms
- Hash Tables
- Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm (Global Sequence Alignment)
- Smith-Waterman Algorithm (Local Sequence Alignment)
- BLAST Algorithm
- Prefix Trie
- Trie Traversal
- Suffix Trie

## Course Structure

The course is divided into three main modules:

1. **Basic Programming Concepts**
   - Essential C and C++ programming concepts
   - Basic algorithms and data structures

2. **Large Scale Data Structures and Their Application**
   - Combining Statistics/Combinatorics with advanced Computer Science concepts
   - Focus on hash tables, bit arrays, and genomic search algorithms

3. **Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms**
   - Advanced data structures (prefix trie, suffix trie, suffix tree)
   - Advanced algorithms for text search and sequence alignment

## Requirements

- C/C++ compiler
- Access to NAU's Monsoon cluster for assignment compilation and execution

## Assessment

- Homework assignments
- 4-5 quizzes (15-20 minutes each)
- 3 module exams (only the highest two scores count towards the final grade)
- Final exam

## Note

This course is designed as a mastery-level course for the Computer Science Masters program and a core foundational course for the Informatics Ph.D. program.
